# PHYS-360 Final Project: Dampened Harmonic Oscillation in a Straw
The relationship between atmospheric pressure and fluid allows one to create an artifical vacuum inside of a straw that creates dampened harmonic motion when the vacuum is released. It is possible to use a mathematical model to graph the motion of fluid in the straw and illustrate the relationship between fluid dynamics and Newton's second law.

## Background

In general this is a cute and simple experiement you can do in their spare time if you'd like to show off to your friends the magic of physics. Pressure differences between the capped interior of the straw and the water cause the fluid to rise when pressure is released due to the lower atmospheric pressure combined with the relatively small volume. I got into this project because breaking down this phenomenon into its constituent parts seems like an interesting perspective to something that just seems like a party trick on the surface.

## Questions

This project will attempt to answer the following questions:

1. Why does dampened harmonic oscillation occur in these circumstances?
2. What is the relationship between Newton's 2nd Law of Motion and dampened harmonic oscillation of fluids?
3. What factors are involved in the dampened harmonic oscillation process?
