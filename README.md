# PHYS-360 Final Project: Time Dilation & Gravitational Force
Time dilation is a natural phenomenon that occurs when objects are subject to gravitational force. The effect of experienced time scales to the effect of gravitational force, with the rate of relatavistic time slowing in proportion to the difference in gravity experienced by two different, comparable entities. The observation of time dilation, and by extension, our experience with the special theory of relativity, is an important factor when considering space-related projects and dynamics.

## Background

In natural science, time dilation is observed when there are sufficiently large differences in gravitational force between two units. Time dilation can be expressed with the following equation:
$$\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \gamma \Delta t$$
Where $\Delta t'$ is the difference in the progression of time between two units (based on the movement of time $\Delta t$), $v$ is the velocity of a moving observer (as the general theory of relativity enables for velocity to be expressed as a gravitational force), and $c$ is the speed of light ($2.99 * 10^8 m/s$). Calculation of time dilation and/or rate of time dilation is vital for practical applications such as the launching of mechanics and objects into orbit (such as the use of atomic clocks) and other space-based technologies, as electronics and equipment must be calibrated to accommodate the differences in gravitational force that can cause misalignment of system time if not checked.

## Questions

This project will attempt to answer the following questions:

1. What gravitational forces does an object experience as it leaves Earth at terminal velocity?
2. How does time dilation affect objects orbiting the Earth and objects that are in deep space (zero gravity)?
3. What kind of objects need to be calibrated for the effects of time dilation, and why?
